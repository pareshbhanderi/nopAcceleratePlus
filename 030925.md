  <div class="section-content">
    <ul class="info-badges">
      <li>Added 5 Star Rating when we have products with 5 Average rating of 5.</li>
      <li>Added Setup Wizard step for remotely hosted Solr instance.</li>
      <li>Implemented Index on Entity Change event. When enabled, it does not wait for Scheduled task to run indexing. This is helpful for near real-time indexing when you've frequently updated catalog. Note that it will work only after full indexing is done. And it won't index when schedule indexing is running.</li>
      <li>Performance Improvement. Added setting for ignoring 'Last Shopping Page'.</li>
      <li>Added Scroll to Top button on Search & Catalog pages.</li>
      <li>Implemented Scroll to top after facet is selected.</li>
      <li>Implemented a Solr down notification, Solr is not reachable. Only Admin will see this message when logged in to admin panel. When Solr is down, we automatically load catalog and search results using default nopCommerce methods, so visitors will not see a broken page.</li>
      <li>Added a field to load dynamic Theme compatibility setting (ThemeFileName & RtlThemeFileName) to support any custom themes.</li>
      <li>Added a feature to Search within Catalog for Category, Manufacturer, Vendor & Product tag pages.</li>
