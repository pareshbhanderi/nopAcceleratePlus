      <li>In case of Subscription license, the nopAccelerate Plus plugin will cease to work. In this case, the Search & Catalog pages will be served from nopCommerce methods instead of nopAccelerate Plugin's methods. You will loose the awesome search & drill down filter features on Search results & Catalog Pages (Category, Manufacturer, Vendor and Tag product listing pages).</li>
      <li>In case of Download license, the nopAccelerate Plus plugin will work as the Download license is perpetual license. However, the access to support & updates will cease to work. So you will not have access to support or new improvements or features released after the license has expired. Therefore, we recommend you to renew your download license every year.</li>
      <li>In case of license expiration, you will also get the automatic email reminder from our system.</li>

      <li>In case of license failure of any kind, your website will have no impact on the features given your license key is genuine and validated once.</li>
      <li>In worst case like validation failure or using of wrong license key or using plugin on unauthorized domain, the plugin features will cease to work.</li>
      <li>Please note that, in any case, license failure will not impact your live website visitors or front end store pages, as they will be served from default nopCommerce methods instead of nopAccelerate Plus methods. And, you will have appropriate license notification only in the administration area of nopCommerce.</li>
